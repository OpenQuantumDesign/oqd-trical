abstract = {Single trapped ions represent elementary quantum systems that are well isolated from the environment. They can be brought nearly to rest by laser cooling, and both their internal electronic states and external motion can be coupled to and manipulated by light fields. This makes them ideally suited for quantum-optical and quantum-dynamical studies under well-controlled conditions. Theoretical and experimental work on these topics is reviewed in the paper, with a focus on ions trapped in radio-frequency (Paul) traps.},

abstract = {The expansion of operators as ordered power series in the annihilation and creation operators 𝑎 and 𝑎† is examined. It is found that normally ordered power series exist and converge quite generally, but that for the case of antinormal ordering the required 𝑐-number coefficients are infinite for important classes of operators. A parametric ordering convention is introduced according to which normal, symmetric, and antinormal ordering correspond to the values 𝑠=+1,0,−1, respectively, of an order parameter 𝑠. In terms of this convention it is shown that for bounded operators the coefficients are finite when 𝑠{\textgreater}0, and the series are convergent when 𝑠{\textgreater}12. For each value of the order parameter 𝑠, a correspondence between operators and 𝑐-number functions is defined. Each correspondence is one-to-one and has the property that the function 𝑓⁡(𝛼) associated with a given operator 𝐹 is the one which results when the operators 𝑎 and 𝑎† occurring in the ordered power series for 𝐹 are replaced by their complex eigenvalues 𝛼 and 𝛼\*. The correspondence which is realized for symmetric ordering is the Weyl correspondence. The operators associated by each correspondence with the set of 𝛿 functions on the complex plane are discussed in detail. They are shown to furnish, for each ordering, an operator basis for an integral representation for arbitrary operators. The weight functions in these representations are simply the functions that correspond to the operators being expanded. The representation distinguished by antinormal ordering expresses operators as integrals of projection operators upon the coherent states, which is the form taken by the 𝑃 representation for the particular case of the density operator. The properties of the full set of representations are discussed and are shown to vary markedly with the order parameter 𝑠.},

abstract = {This text will thoroughly update the existing literature on atomic physics. Intended to accompany an advanced undergraduate course in atomic physics, the book will lead the students up to the latest advances and the applications to Bose-Einstein Condensation of atoms, matter-wave inter-ferometry and quantum computing with trapped ions. The elementary atomic physics covered in the early chapters should be accessible to undergraduates when they are first introduced to the subject. To complement the usual quantum mechanical treatment of atomic structure the book strongly emphasizes the experimental basis of the subject, especially in the later chapters. It includes ample tutorial material (examples, illustrations, chapter summaries, graded problem sets).},
