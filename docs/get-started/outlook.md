# Features in development

- [ ] `oqd_trical.mechanical` uses atomic interface from [`oqd-core`](https://github.com/openquantumdesign/oqd-core).
- [ ] `oqd_trical.mechanical` change autograd backend to jax.
- [ ] Compute Zeeman shifts based on magnetic field.
- [ ] Rule for rotating wave approximation.
- [ ] Rule for moving into interaction picture for a rotating frame of reference.
- [ ] Rule for performing adiabatic elimination.
- [ ] Unit test for `oqd_trical`
- [ ] [`ConstructHamiltonian`][oqd_trical.light_matter.compiler.codegen] support for sequential within parallel protocol
- [ ] Sort out units
